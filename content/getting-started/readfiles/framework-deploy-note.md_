[Framework-deploy](https://github.com/cisco-sso/framework-deploy) is a git repo which implments the KDF deployment
pattern. The boilerplate structure in framework-deploy is made to fit perfectly with the tools available in the KDK
container.  One may fork this repo as a basis for implementing the framework-deploy pattern for private kubernetes
clusters.
