In this section, explore your newly provisioned Kubernetes cluster along with all of the basic services you have
deployed via the [framework-deploy](https://github.com/cisco-sso/framework-deploy) code repository.  You will connect to
the admin panels of the services you have deployed.  Connecting to these admin panels requires a web browser which is
configured to use the KDK as a [SOCKS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCKS) proxy.  The KDK will proxy all web requests
to the internal ingress, so that one may access the dashboards using the configured cluster DNS name
(*.docker-for-desktop.example.org).
